# Disclaimer
I do not pretend everything under that line to be accurate as of now. Most of it is probably work in progress for sure. If you find any issue on the website, feel free to sue the Issues sections to let me know accordingly.
# Introduction
The purpose of this website (https://loadeksdi.com) is to enter my own universe. It's a sort of a mix between a portfolio and a blog. I will expose there my experience, projects, interests and also my recent (current ?) activity. My objective is to train my web development skills through something than can be useful and pleasant for me to realize. My skills in designing are very limited indeed, but I want to try to do something that has a decent aesthetic with the knowledge I have.

# Concept
I want to show people that are interested in my life or my projects what I am able to do and leave my own mark over the Internet. I do not wish it to be seen by everyone of course, but some friends or even random people that just want to see what I'm doing as a developer and as person overall actually can thanks to this site. I also want it to be as accurate and recent as possible, that's why I'm also developing a back-end service that sends data to the website oftenly about my activity and performance.

# Features
- A responsive frameworkless HTML/CSS/JS website (since I wanted to work again on the basics)
- Accurate information about myself (hi professional recruiters !:) )
- An integrated chat service (see https://github.com/Loadeksdi/loadeksdi_bot/ to take a look at back-end)
# Why do I use Github Pages ?
I think that Github Pages is a good option for me to try this hosting feature in this project context. I've been a Github User for a few years and I don't even know the half of its possibilities, I thought this was the occasion. By doing so, I discovered it and here are the pros I found : 
- I'm not hosting the website's files (I only have a small storage capacity on my private server)
- I have my custom domain name
- Almost realtime updates after commiting files to the project

# Contact
If you want to enter in contact with me, feel free to do so directly on the website, you'll have the possibility to chat with me as soon as necessary.

Enjoy your stay !
