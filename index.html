                    <h4>League of Legends</h4>
                    <p>League of Legends is one of the first online game I've played with Minecraft. It always and
                        still
                        has
                        a special place in my heart. I've spent thousands of hours playing to it, and I feel like
                        all
                        big
                        video games franchises bring a whole universe into their games. Despite its questionnable
                        behaviour
                        community
                        and
                        toxic ambience, I'd say it's more than a game, it's a story, that can be perceived for
                        players as an involvment into a community where rank becomes a social construct. In
                        addition, its fame and large diffusion thanks to competitions, streaming and ads makes
                        League of Legends a global movement. I'm really happy about the
                        announcement of the MMORPG based on LoL's universe and feel truly hyped to play it.

                    <h4>Minecraft</h4>
                    <p>Minecraft is actually the first online game I've ever played as far as I remember. I've spend
                        a
                        lot
                        of hours playing to it with my middle school friends too. In my opinion, Minecraft is THE
                        game.
                        Its ambience, music,
                        concept which is relatively simple (a cubic world) makes it perfect and easily
                        understandable
                        for
                        everyone.
                        If humanity had to explain what a video game is, they probably should pick Minecraft. Even
                        nowadays, I play it sometimes on my <a href="https://discord.gg/VSDh5AZ8YV"

                        think
                        that the command blocks are a part of the reason of why I showed interest into
                        programming
                        later
                        on.</p>

                    <h4>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h4>
                    <p>Skyrim is the only opus of The Elder Scrolls I've been playing to. Its massive content and
                        universe
                        made me simply love it. The action takes place in a fantasy medieval era, which corresponds
                        to
                        my
                        favourite kind of historical period. This is the example, in my mind, that some video games
                        are
                        better to play solo than online, especially when designers put a lot of work in the game
                        lore
                        and
                        environment.</p>

            <h3>Arts</h3>
            <p>Just a quick note about art: I'm not an artist myself. I do not wish to put effort in discovering any
                art
                for an enough long period of time for it to be interesting. It may change a day or another but
                what I
                want to share here is my taste in genres of art I truly appreciate for their aesthetic. I don't even
                have an huge artistic culture, I've just discovered things that I like and I think that's enough to
                spread content.</p>
            <h4>Music</h4>
            <p>Don't get me wrong, music is the art I enjoy the most. For me, the combination of both lyrics and
                instrumental opens the door to a universe of universes. Each artist or group of artists can create their
                own art and spread emotions all over the world to people who will be either moved by the text or
                pleased by the instrumental or even both. For me, this is the main reason why this art is interesting,
                it shows how
                themes can be revisited or created from scratch. It is one of the greatest humanity's shard of culture.
                <br> About me : I do
                listen to a lot of music, and try to listen to a lot of different genres of it. My favourite style
                is rap for sure, French or international though. I love to spread my discovers to my friends and
                get their feedback about it to know if they enjoyed it as I did or not. Here is a quick list of artists
                or bands that I like to listen to : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vald (French rap)</li>
                <li>Lil Peep (Rap)</li>

            <h4>Literature</h4>
            <p>When I was younger, I did 4 years of theater so I was in contact with the culture of plays from famous
                and less known authors. I use to
                read a lot of fantasy books such as Cats of the Clan, Narnia and His Dark Materials. I tried other
                styles like Harlan Coben's books or the CHERUB saga for the thrilling. Not only reading novels, I was
                also reading a lot
                of comics. Although, I read a lot a few years ago, I do not read as much at the moment, because
                I don't find the time of it and prefer to spend it into others activities (even if I'd like to discover
                philosophical and religious books). During my high school formation, I had no choice but
                to read traditional books from French authors and I find myself surprised in enjoying a lot of
                them, especially poetry. As far as I'm concerned, my favourite is Flowers of Evil from Charles
                Baudelaire since I had the
                opportunity to analyze it in class and personally at home saw the parallel with Columbine's song "Les
                prélis" which main
                theme refers a lot to Baudelaire's original work.</p>
