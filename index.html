            <p>I don't really know why I created this page. I'm glad you came tho. Please enjoy your stay. Most of
                things are probably WIP but I'd like to create a dynamic version of my universe based on my Internet
                activity.</p>

            <h2>What I'm doing with my life</h2>
            <p>As you may have understood it, I'm a Computer Science student. I do follow an engineer cursus at EFREI
                Paris school. In addition, I work partly for BNP Paribas as a Designer/Developer intervening for topics
                such as obsolescence,
                application maintenance and development of new features.<br> Last year I was already working as a
                helpdesk technician for the Salvation Army and got my University Technological Diploma at Paris
                University.</p>

            <h2>My tastes</h2>
            <h3>Video games</h3>
            <p>I'm a huge video games player, I've been playing since I was 6 years old. My favourite games are League
                of Legends, Minecraft, The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim, MMORPGs and most of Nintendo franchises.</p>
            <div class="lol">
                <img src="assets/images/lol.jpg" alt="Twitch : a champion from the video game League of Legends">
                <h4>League of Legends</h4>
                <p>League of Legends is one of the first online game I've played with Minecraft. It always and still has
                    a special place in my heart. I've spend thousands of hours playing to it, and I feel like all big
                    video games franchises bring a whole universe into their games. Despite its terrible community and
                    toxic ambience, I'd say it's more than a game, it's a story, that can be perceived as a social
                    movement of people from my generation playing it in my opinion. I'm really happy about the
                    announcement of the MMORPG based on LoL's universe and truly hyped to be playing to it.</p>

            <div class="minecraft">
                <img src="assets/images/minecraft.png" alt="A screenshot from the video game Minecraft">
                <h4>Minecraft</h4>
                <p>Minecraft is actually the first online game I've ever played as far as I remember. I've spend a lot
                    of hours playing to it too. As far as I'm concerned, Minecraft is THE game. Its ambience, music,
                    concept which is relatively simple (a cubic world) makes it perfect and comprehensible for everyone.
                    If humanity had to explain what a video game is, they probably should pick Minecraft. I also think
                    that the command blocks are a part of the reason of why I've been curious about coding.</p>

            <div class="skyrim">
                <img src="assets/images/skyrim.png" alt="A screenshot the video game The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim">
                <h4>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h4>
                <p>Skyrim is the only opus of The Elder Scrolls I've been playing to. Its massive content and universe
                    made me simply love it. The action takes place in a fantasy medieval era, which corresponds to my
                    favourite kind of historical period. This is the example, in my mind, that some video games are
                    better to play solo than online, especially when designers put a lot of work in the game lore and
                    environment.</p>

                <h4>Other games</h4>
                <p>There are so many games that I've been playing but the objective is not to explain for all of them
                    why did I particularly enjoyed them. I'll just give some more examples so you have a wider spectrum
                    of my tastes:</p>

            <h3>Arts</h3>
            <p>Just a quick note about art: I'm not an artist myself. I do not wish to put effort in discovering any art
                for an enough long period of time for it to be interesting. It might change a day or another but what I
                want to share here is my taste in genres of art I truly appreciate for their aesthetic. I don't even
                have an huge artistic culture, I've just discovered things that I like and I think that's enough to
                spread content.</p>
